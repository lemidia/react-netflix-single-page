![Alt text](/images/pic1.png)

## Demo 

https://netflix-lemidia.firebaseapp.com/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 적용된 기술

- tmdb movie data (api)
- Material UI
- Axios (for data fetching)
- react-youtube (for youtube video embedding)

## How to Run

1. Terminal을 열고 `npm install` 명령으로 dependency(의존성)를 설치합니다. (사전에 node.js가 설치되어 있어야 한다.)

2. /src 폴더 밑에 keys.js 파일을 만들고, 자신의 tmdb api_key를 아래의 <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE> 에 기입합니다.

```javascript
// keys.js
const API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>";

export default API_KEY;
```

3. Local에서 실행하기 위해 Terminal에 `npm start`를 입력합니다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
